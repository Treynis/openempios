	<h2>Postgres Database Server Installation Instructions</h2>

	<div style="padding: 3px">
	<p>
	Currently OpenEMPI is only supported on the Postgres Database. Although 
	internally the software has been developed without any dependencies on a particular database, 
	we have not tested OpenEMPI under other database servers. If there is an interest to have it support
	other databases, please raise an issue in the Project Tracker or better yet, implement the support
	and contribute it to the community.
	</p>
	<p>
   	The PostgreSQL <a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#windows">site</a> has detailed
   	installation instructions for the database but we provide some basic installation instructions here to get
   	you started. Refer to the PostgreSQL site or post a message in the 
   	<a href="https://openhie.projects.openhealthtools.org/ds/postMessage.do?dsForumId=208">Users forum</a> 
   	if you run into problems.
   	</p>

   	The latest version of PostgreSQL that has been tested is 8.3.7. After you download the one-click
   	distribution, run the executable, which will bring up the setup window shown below.

	After pressing the next button, you are given the option of selecting the installation directory for
	Postgres. You can install it anywhere but for the rest of these instructions we will assume that you
	selected the default directory of d:\servers\postgres-8.3. Pressing the next button takes you to the
	next screen which allows you to select the directory under which to store data. The default directory
	is fine as a subdirectory of the root directory for Postgres. The next page allows you to select a
	password for the database superuser posgres account. If the postgres service account already exists
	on your system because of a previous installation of postgres, you must use that existing account's
	password to continue. If the postgres service account does not exist prior to the installation of
	Postgres, the installer may complain about you entering an invalid password for the service account.
	You can get around this issue by first creating the Windows User account postgres, assigning it a
	password and then running the Postgres installation again.

	</p>
	<p>
	The next page allows you to set the port on which postgres listens for requests on. Unless you already
	have another application using that port, you can use the default of 5432. The last and final wizard
	screen allows you to select the locale to be used by the database cluster. Pressing Next will take you
	to the final screen before installation actually begins.
