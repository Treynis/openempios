        <strong>OpenEMPI Architecture - Version 2.0</strong>
    </font>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    After the redesign and refactoring of OpenEMPI, the architecture of the software is now based on the principles of Service 
	Oriented Architecture consisting of a number of independent services that are loosely coupled from the rest. Each service
	is exposed to other services through a well defined interface. Figure 1 illustrates the high level architecture of OpenEMPI
	bringing out the multi-layered architecture of the software. The diagram of Figure 1 is not an exhaustive list of all the
	components that comprise the system but only shows a subset of them for the purpose of illustrating the layered architecture
	of the system and to bring out the loose coupling between the services.
