	<h2>JBoss Application Server Installation Instructions</h2>

	<div style="padding: 3px">
	<p>
	OpenEMPI has only been tested on the JBoss Application Server although it is 
	deployed as a J2EE application that can be hosted on any J2EE-compliant application
	server. OpenEMPI 1.0 exposes its interface using a few session beans that were
	implemented using the EJB 2.1 specification. OpenEMPI 2.0, if deployed as a J2EE
	application, utilizes the EJB 3.0 specification to expose its functionality using
	a few stateless session beans. If you need support on another J2EE application you
	may raise an issue in the <a href="https://openhie.projects.openhealthtools.org/servlets/tracking/remcurreport/true/template/null/action/SetHomePage/homemode/enter">
	Project Tracker</a> or do the port and contribute instructions back to the project.   
	</p>
	<p>
	You can download the JBoss application server from the following 
	<a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads">link</a>. We have only tested OpenEMPI against
	JBoss 4.0.5 and 4.2.3 although it may be supported on other versions as well. The instructions
	below assume that you have downloaded the 4.2.3 version of the application server which is
	currently available as 
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=22866&filename=jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip&a=56835677">
	jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip</a>. Installation of the application server is as easy as expanding the zip file
	at an appropriate directory. In these instructions we assume the zip file is expanded under
	d:\servers\jboss-4.2.3.
	</p>

	This completes the installation of the application server software. <a href="https://openhie.projects.openhealthtools.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=if5D0X">Back
