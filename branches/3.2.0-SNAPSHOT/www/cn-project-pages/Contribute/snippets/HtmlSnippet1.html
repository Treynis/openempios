<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p><font size="4">How to Contribute</font></p><p><font size="2">OpenHIE is an open source project and as such, it can only improve through contributions from the open source community. If you see any area where it does not fit your needs, jump in and build that component. If you don't believe you have the time or skills needed to develop the contribution yourself, use the <a href="https://openhie.projects.openhealthtools.org/servlets/tracking/remcurreport/true/template/null/action/SetHomePage/homemode/enter">Project Tracker</a> to enter a feature request.</font></p><p><font size="2">To get started, download the code, try it and see what you think. This will give you a chance to test out the installation process, use the documentation in addition to the software and provide us feedback, but preferrably contributions towards their improvement.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2"><p><font size="4">Documentation</font></p><p><font size="2">As with any open source project, although the documentation is very important in getting the community to understand what the project is making available, it usually lags behind the software itself. At least for now, this is the area where we need the most help.</font></p><p><font size="2">If you are interested in helping with the documentation, feel free to fix what is there, contribution more documentation, or develop your own tutorials based on your experience. All the documentation for the software will be available on the Wiki. In order to gain access to editing the Wiki, please send an email requesting the necessary privileges along with a description of how you would like to help.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="2"><font size="4">Reporting Bugs</font></font></p><p><font size="2">If you find a bug with the code please at the very least, report it by creating an issue through the <a href="https://openhie.projects.openhealthtools.org/servlets/tracking/remcurreport/true/template/null/action/SetHomePage/homemode/enter">Project Tracker</a>. This allows us to keep track of issues reported by the community and to resolve them as a community. If you have worked enough with the code and fell comfortable with it, beyond reporting the defect, go ahead and provide us with a patch for it.</font></p><p>If you are an Eclipse user and would like to generate a patch for a fix you made, the process is very easy. First you must install the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> plugin. You should then be able to right-click on a file and select Team -&gt; Create Patch. You can then save the file and attach it to the issue you need to create through the <a href="https://openhie.projects.openhealthtools.org/servlets/tracking/remcurreport/true/template/null/action/SetHomePage/homemode/enter">Project Tracker</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="4">Becoming a Committer</font></p><p>Becoming a committer on this project works pretty much the same way as in most other open source projects. Much like the Apache community, this project operates under a meritocracy, meaning that the more you participate the more likely it is that you will be invited by one of the existing members to join the project as a committer. To work towards becoming a committer, get involved and contribute in the forums by helping other members use the software, edit the documentation and contribute patches to fix existing issues or provided new enhancements.</p><p>Once you have contributed and your work is of good quality, rest assured that one of the existing members will extend an invitation for you to become a committer. As a committer you then take on the responsibility of continuing to help out others in the community, extend the documentation of the software in the wiki, contribute bug reports, fixes, and new features.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></font></font></font></font>
