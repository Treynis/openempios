	<h2>Overview of the OpenHIE Project</h2>
	
	<div style="padding: 3px;">
	<p>
	The Open Health Information Exchange (openHIE) project is creating an
	accessible framework for the development of community health
	information exchange solutions. These will improve the quality,
	clinical efficiency, and safety of health care through making patient
	medical data more available to health providers at the point of care.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Currently the Open Health Information Exchange project consists of an
	implementation of a standards-based Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI).
	If you are not familiar with what an EMPI is, you can learn more about it
	<a href="#WhatIsAnEMPI">here.</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Developers, subject matter experts and clinical practioners are invited
	to participate.

	<h2>Background</h2>
	
	<div style="padding: 3px;">
	<p>
	In November 2006, Jonah Frohlich of the California HealthCare Foundation (CHCF) 
	proposed an open source road map for their Care Data Exchange (CDE) software. 
	About the same time Stuart Turner and Will Ross launched an on-line
	investigation to catalogue and evaluate open source identity matching software.
	They formed a team that extracted the useful portions of the Care Data Exchange (CDE)
	software resulting in the OpenEMPI software. The team consisted of Scott Duvall, 
	Shaun Grannis, Richard Haley, Odysseas Pentakalos, Will Ross, Stuart Turner, and
	Jeffrey Wallace. The extracted software was made free of proprietary components 
	making it suitable for contribution to the open source community. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In August 2008 the California HealthCare Foundation contributed these software
	components to the Open Health Tools community. In November 2008, <a href="www.sysnetint.com">
	SYSNET International</a> with a small grant from the California HealthCare 
	Foundation worked on enhancing the software that was initially contributed to
	the Open Health Tools community. The software went through considerable redesign
	and refactoring to resolve the limitations that were presented in the code that was
	extracted from the CDE software. The current 2.0 release of the openhie software has
	a number of improvements over the 1.0 release:
	
	<ul>
		<li>The software has been re-architected using a SOA-based approached and now 
		consists of a number of loosely coupled components.</li>
		<li>The matching algorithm of the Master Patient Index service is utilized by the
		rest of the software through a well-defined interface. This allows additional algorithms
		to be implemented and plugged into the server without any changes to the rest of the
		server.</li>
		<li>The baseline 2.0 release includes both a deterministic and a probabilistic algorithm
		for patient matching both of which are configurable through a file</li>
		<li>The data model has been designed to both support a wide variety of environments while
		at the same time to allow for efficient computations for identifying duplicate records.</li>
		<li>The technologies used for implementation of the 2.0 release are the typical modern
		technologies used to implement production level application and include J2EE 1.5, Spring
		and Hibernate.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="WhatIsAnEMPI">What is an Enterprise Master Patient Index?</a></h2>

	<div style="padding: 3px;">

	<p>Databases are used today to store and maintain data about various physical entities such as books, items
	you may purchase from a store, orders, and patients. Very often the need arises to integrate data from
	multiple sources. For example the Provider Access to Immunization Register Securely (PAiRS) system is a database
	that contains records on more than 2 million children aged 0-18 years residing in the State of North
	Carolina. This database was created by merging the data from the North Carolina Immunization Registry,
	the Immunization system of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and the immunization system of
	Kaiser Permanente.</p>
	  
	<p>When the need arises to integrate the data about
	an entity using information from multiple sources into one comprehensive view, the heterogeneity between
	how information is stored at each individual source becomes apparent. This heterogeneity is usually the
	result of multiple factors including the lack of consistent quality control when data is captured at each
	of the individual data sources, differing data representations of the same entity by different sources,
	and missing integrity constraints, normalization or de-normalization.
	</p>
	
	<p>This heterogeneity is classified into one of two types: <em>structural</em> and <em>semantic</em>. 
	Structural heterogeneity refers to the use of different attributes to represent a given entity whereas
	semantic heterogeneity refers to the use of different values and semantics in association with the same
	attributes of an entity. For example, one organization may choose to use a social security number to
	uniquely identify a patient whereas another organization may use the patient's driver's license and make
	the social security number an optional attribute. This would be an example of structural heterogeneity.
	An example of semantic heterogeneity would be the treatment of the gender field. One database may use keep
	track of a person's gender which can take on the value of "Male" or "Female". Another database may keep
	track of a person's sex using the value set 'M', 'F', 'U' for male, female and unknown. Such discrepancies
	are all too common when data from multiple sources needs to be integrated.
	</p>

	<p>Record linkage is the term used to refer to the process of linking together records of data from different sources
	that refer to the same entity despite the presence of both structural and semantic heterogeneity between the
	sources. A Master Patient Index (MPI) is a computer system that applies record linkage for the purpose of
	building a unique index for every patient at a health care organization. An Enterprise Master Patient Index
	extends the scope of the MPI across an enterprise integrating data from multiple individual data sources and
	possibly multiple MPIs.
