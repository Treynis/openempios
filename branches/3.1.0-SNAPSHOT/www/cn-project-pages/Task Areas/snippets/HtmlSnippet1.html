The task is to review the code base, evaluate it critically,&nbsp;and fully understand its design.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><ul><li><em><u>Productize the Source Code</u></em></li></ul><blockquote><p>Productize the source code for the community release. This work will include an organized approach to release numbering, release of branches, the transition from an internal alpha to a public beta and a roadmap toward stabilization. Other activities should focus on well written technical and end-user documentation, including concise installation or build artifacts, and a well-written end-user guide that clearly outlines features, proper use and cautionary advice regarding risks associated with inappropriate use of the application. The project community tools should have clearly organized user-facing components with methods to encourage users and administrators to submit feedback (e.g., usability, feature requests, alternative use cases, etc.).</p></blockquote><ul><li><em><u>Requirements Specification</u></em></li></ul><blockquote><p>Complete a software requirements specification. This activity should include subject matter experts in patient matching algorithms as well as software engineers to insure that the objective of algorithm modularity is not only feasible, but functional and extensible. The application should be sufficiently modular so that one or more patient matching components may be readily embedded without changes in source code. Additional testing, including regression, black box and gray box testing of the algorithm with realistic patient data sets, is expected.</p></blockquote><ul><li><em><u>Formal Use Cases</u></em></li></ul><blockquote><p>Build formal use cases. Develop one or more scenarios or representations of the existing project design against a more idealized design based on evolving requirements gathering and feedback from the user community. UML engineering diagrams as well as textual use cases need to continue to be developed openly (e.g., project wiki, etc.).</p></blockquote><ul><li><br /><em><u>Review Logical and Data Model</u></em></li></ul><blockquote><p>Review and annotate the logical and data model. Changes to the data model should&nbsp;also include improved represtation of data element metadata (e.g., data type, descriptions, concept mapping, enumeration of value domains when they exist, etc.).</p></blockquote><ul><li><br /><em><u>Gap Analysis</u></em></li></ul><blockquote><p>Complete a gap analysis comparing openHIE with other initiatives, frameworks and standards. Compare the openHIE architecture design, components and functionality with the Open Health Framework's PIX/PDQ and clinical document metadata standard (XDS), HL7&rsquo;s Clinical Document Architecture and others. <br /></p></blockquote>
