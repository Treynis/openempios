        <strong>OpenEMPI Architecture - Version 2.0</strong>
    </font>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p> After the redesign and refactoring of OpenEMPI, the architecture of the software is now based on the principles of Service 
	Oriented Architecture consisting of a number of independent services that are loosely coupled from the rest. Each service
	is exposed to other services through a well defined interface. Figure 1 illustrates the high level architecture of OpenEMPI
	bringing out the multi-layered architecture of the software. The diagram of Figure 1 is not an exhaustive list of all the
	components that comprise the system but only shows a subset of them for the purpose of illustrating the layered architecture
	of the system and to bring out the loose coupling between the services.

<p> Another benefit of the service oriented architecture of OpenEMPI is that since the key components like the matching and blocking 
algorithms are only exposed to the other services of the system through a well defined interface, alternate implementations of those
components can be implemented and plugged in independently of the rest of the system. This capability is utilized in the implementation
of matching algorithms. Currently OpenEMPI provides two distinct implementation of the matching algorithm. A deterministic exact version
and a probabilistic one based on the Fellegi-Sunter algorithm. Depending of your requirements you can choose which version you prefer
to use by simple changing the Spring configuration of the system. Figure 2 illustrates the pluggable architecture of the system.
