	<h2>Installation and Configuration of OpenEMPI 1.0</h2>

	<div style="padding: 3px">
	<p>
	Here we present instructions on how to install OpenEMPI 1.0 using the binary distribution that is available
	from the <a href="/releases.html">releases</a> page. The first step is to extract the contents of the archive. The
	archive can be extracted anywhere but for the rest of these instructions we will refer to that location as
	HOME.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Run Postgres Admin</h3>
	<p>
	If this is the first time that you are installing OpenEMPI on your system and have not created the database instance
	yet, this will be your first step. The Postgres 8.3 installation includes an administrative application called pgAdmin
	that should be located at d:\servers\postgres-8.3\bin\pgAdmin3.exe. Running the executable will bring up the GUI
	that allows you to connect to the database server. In order to connect to the server you will need to use the password
	that you assigned the postgres user when you installed the database server.

	</p>
	
	<h3>Create Database User Role</h3>
	<p>
	Before you create a schema for the new database instance, you need to create a user role. From the tree
	control on the left right click on "Login Roles" and select "New Login Role" from the menu. Create a new role
	named openempi and ensure the screen has the following information filled in.

	</p>
	
	<h3>Create Database Instance</h3>
	<p>
	To create a database instance for openempi right click on the Databases icon and select the "New Database.." link from the
	menu. In the dialog that comes up set the name of the new database to openempi and from the Owner drop down select
	openempi as the owner of the database. Now that the schema is in place, you need to add the database objects for
	openempi. In the Postgres Admin application select Tools->Query Tool from the menu. From the Query Tool select the File->Open
	menu option to open the sql script that resides in the dist/conf directory of the OpenEMPI 1.0 distribution. The name
	of the file is ICS_schema_create-postgres.sql. After loading the file execute the script which should successfully create
	all the database objects that are needed for OpenEMPI.
	</p>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Deploy J2EE Application</h3>
	<p>
	Now that the database is configured you can deploy the application to the application server. This is as simple as copying the
	ear file from the HOME directory where OpenEMPI was extracted as dist/openempi.ear to the application servers deployment directory
	which is at d:\servers\jboss-4.2.3\server\default\deploy. Before starting the server you also need a few more configuration steps
	for the application. You must first create a data source that associates the logical data source name to the physical data source
	that refers to the database instance you created in the previous steps. To do this simply create a file called postgres-ds.xml
	in the application servers deployment directory. The contents of this file are shown <a href="postgres-ds.xml">here</a>. 
	If during the database server installation you selected a port other than the default of 5432, you need to make the appropriate
	change in the postgres-ds.xml file.
	</p>
	
	The last thing that you need to do is copy the two OpenEMPI files ICS.properties and IcsSql.xml from the HOME/dist/conf directory to the
	root directory of your application server (by default d:\servers\jboss-4.2.3). You should now be able to start the server and the OpenEMPI
	application should be deployed correctly.
